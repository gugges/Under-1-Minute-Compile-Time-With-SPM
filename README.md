# Under 1 Minute Compile Times with Swift Package Manager Modules

## Installation

Make sure to run ```pod install``` before building the MainApp.xcworkspace

## Usage

If you want to see slow compile times, open MainApp.xcworkspace/

If you want to see fast compile times, open TestApp/TestApp.xcworkspace/

Note that all Modules are shared between the MainApp and TestApp. This allows you to code a feature in the TestApp with super quick compile times. When the feature is complete, it is ready to be shared and imported into the larger MainApp code base.
