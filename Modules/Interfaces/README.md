# Interfaces

## About

The Interfaces module contains all the shared protocols for the application. This module is the highest level of the dependency tree as all features must import interfaces in order to have a common contract for communication between one another.

## Common Usages

In this sample app, you can see usages related to state management, experiments, logging, networking and routing. Interfaces can also be a location where you store app wide models so that they can be easily understood and passed between feature modules.
